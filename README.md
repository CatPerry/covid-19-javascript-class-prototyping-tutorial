Disclaimer: You MAY notice a touch of opinionated text in here. It's just a means of venting, but I want you to add your own. If you want to directly contribute to this CoronaVirus Class and its docs, just open an issue and let's get it PR'd.

Use this as a means to vent about covid-19 AND most importantly to explore the native JavaScript functionalites that include Classes, inheritance, prototyping, hoisting, etc! This class is for all of us!
